 ## User Story and How It Works
 - AS A PERSON who enjoys playing community-based team sports
 - I AM INTERESTED in an application that provides me with information and 
    allows me to participate in specific events in my local area on a pick-up basis
 - AND TO CREATE EVENTS myself that could attract like-minded players

## How It Works

- The nav bar provides anchors for Home, About, Events, Profile, and ContactUs.
- The About anchor provides information about the thereWillBeCode team and the PickUpSports application
- The ContactUs anchor provides information on how to contact the developers for feedback and support
- Users are invited to register/sign-up and to create a Profile page
- The Events page allows users to find Events in which they might wish to participate
- The Events page also allows users to Create Events, including information on
- the sport, date & time, location & venue, number of players sought, and other descriptive details

## Installation Guide
